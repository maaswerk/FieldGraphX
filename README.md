## 🔍 Project description

**FieldGraphX** is a tool for **visualization and analysis of data flows** in Microsoft Dynamics CRM.  
It helps developers, administrators and project managers to **intuitively understand and manage** field relationships, triggers and flows** in CRM systems.
Very useful when fields are deleted to see in which flows the field is used and which flows/logic are based on it

---

## ✨ Main functions

### 1. flow hierarchy visualization
- Visualization of data flows and their dependencies
- Support for simple to complex visualizations (arrow diagrams, flow maps)

### 2. trigger and field groups
- Grouping of flows based on trigger and set fields
- Quick identification of relevant trigger/setter flows

### 3. interactive user interface
- Flow cards with details: trigger, status, hierarchy
- Zoom and scroll functions for large diagrams

### 4. in-depth data analysis
- Analysis of all relevant flows incl. ancestors
- Hierarchical sorting & debugging view for maximum transparency

### 5 Seamless Dynamics CRM integration
- Direct connection to your Dynamics CRM instance
- Access to entities and fields - directly from the app
